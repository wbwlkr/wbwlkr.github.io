**Finally**,<br>
After 10 years of coding, I decided to create this blog.

Most of what I will put here will be about computer science I read or wrote :<br>
Such as projects, snippets, scripts and some hacks or advices to share with all.

I choose Jekyll because it generates static websites from markdown files.<br>
Simple, efficient and blog-oriented.<br>
It's written in Ruby.

Obviously, static websites have *less flaws* than dynamic ones built on *more or less* secure framework and CMS...<br>
I say *less flaws* because there is no such thing as 100% secure.

I will soon write an article on how to create your own Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages.

That's all for now !

See you.
