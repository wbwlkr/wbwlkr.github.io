Another curious, free-thinker and problem-solving oriented person.<br>
I love to play, tinker and tamper with all kind of stuff since I was a child.

## Developer story

**10 years ago**, I discovered coding through the common web languages and technologies.<br>
From then, I learned to code in several programming languages and finally fell for Python and Web Security.

I have more than 7 years of professional developping projects, with companies from little to big and multinational brands, where I created from scratch, modified and optimized all kind of web apps, API, scripts, ERP, shopping websites or social networks.
